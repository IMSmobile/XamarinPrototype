## Evaluate ecosystem from Xamarin

### Global Player using Xamarin (req 53)
Xamarin is used by Microsoft, Siemens, Pinterest, Slack and over 15'000 other customers (Source: https://www.xamarin.com/customers)
### Challenge documentation: Report on how useful it was when developing prototype app, ist there a upgrade guide, do example work (try three)?
Official Guide/Documentation is excellent (and very enourmous). Sometimes is hard to find the boundary to normal C-Sharp (not everthing is supported by Xamarin). There are good examples from Xamarin.Forms on Github, which explain many basic functions. Github-Examples worked fine.
### Challenge community: How useful where the search results (req 52)?
The xamarin forum activity seems to be okay and official xamarin stuff also answer questions there. Many things could be also found over stackoverflow.com.
### Calculate expected financial cost for project (req 50)
No additional cost for IDE with Xamarin. 
### Apps can also run in a Browser (req 3)
There is a project in development to use Xamarin with a Browserplugin (https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp).
### Have been shown to work with CI and CD (req 9, 10)
Build server possible with Jenkins or Teamfoundation Build. Also Testcloud for different devices possible (fee required).
